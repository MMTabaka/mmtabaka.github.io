          <p>Hi, my name is </p>
          <p><b>Milosz Tabaka</b></p>

        <p>I enjoy building websites.</p>

    <h1 id="about">1. About Me</h1>
    <p>I am a 2nd year Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science student at The University of Sheffield. My interest
      in web development sparked during last academic year, when I was introduced to basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
      in The Web and Internet Technologies module.
    </p>
    <p>I designed and built this website to share some of my academic and personal projects as well as to reflect on the
    progress I made since my first steps in programming.

        <h2>Web-based App to Match Mentors with Mentees</h2>
        <p>A website application allowing university students to find a suitable mentor for them. </p>
        <p>This assignment helped me develop my leadership and team working skills as well as required to learn new
          for me
          technologies in a short period of time.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Sinatra</li>
          <li>Sequel</li>
          <li>SQLite</li>
          <li>RSpec</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="uni-project">
        <h2>Wine Browser App</h2>
        <p>A GUI application that takes user's text input with different wines and their properties and applies
          sorting
          on the list based on chosen filters. It displays the sorted list in a user interface along with minimum,
          maximum
          and average properties as well as with histogram, which graphically shows proportion of wines based on
          selected property.
        </p>
        <p>This assignment helped me better understand OOP concept as well as Java Swing framework and put
          everything
          into practice.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Java</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="uni-project">
        <h2>Map Traversal Problem</h2>
        <p>A problem which required to accommodate a Branch and Bound algorithm to terrain map in order to return
          the
          shortest possible
          path between two points on mountain terrain with the least possible climbing. The second part of the
          project
          was to implement
          A* algorithm based on the code from previous part by including different heuristics in calculating the
          distance and then compare
          the efficiency of both algorithms.</p>
        <p>This assignment helped me understand theoretical knowledge better by practice. It also introduced me to a
          LaTeX report template.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Java</li>

        <h2>My First Personal Website</h2>
        <p>A website containing information about me as well as interactive quiz and charts.
        </p>
        <p>This assignment helped me put my basic at the time HTML, CSS and JS knowledge into practice. I have also
          learned how to use
          Google Chrome Developer Tools for development and Google lighthouse for testing. The project also brought
          my
          attention
          to importance of accessibility in webpages.

        <h2>Global Engineering Challenge</h2>
        <p>A week long team project gathering students from different engineering areas. Our task was to find a solution
          to frequent power outages and low electrical
          coverage in Lobitos and Piedritas areas in
          northern coast of Peru. Our idea was to install small wind turbines near households connected to national
          power grid and to store energy using car batteries.
          It would increase the coverage, generate enough energy for a household
          and with enough amount of batteries also allow residents to sell some of the energy to the national grid.</p>
        <p>This project streghen my leadership skills, required me to work in different engineering field than my
          own
          as well as
          improved my presentation and organisation skills.</p>

      <div class="uni-project">
        <h2>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2>
        <p>A simple tic-tac-toe Game allowing two users to pick their positions in turns until there is a winner or game
          finishes in draw.
        </p>
        <p>This project was some sort of a warm-up while learning Python and helped me put some basic expression into
          practice</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="uni-project">
        <h2>Simple Banking System</h2>
        <p>A simple app allowing user to create a new bank account by generating valid by Luhn algorithm card number and
          PIN, add money to the account,
          and make a transfer by providing another card number that is present in the database.
        </p>
        <p>This project helped me to improve my software designing skills, put some new Python expression into practive
          as well as required to implement a database in Python code.</p>

          <li>Python</li>
