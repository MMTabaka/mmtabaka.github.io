        <h1 id="about">1. About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a 2nd year international student from Poland at The University of Sheffield.
          My major is BSc Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science.</p>
        <p>My story with web development started in the 1st year of my studies.
          The Web and Interent Technology module introduced me to the basics of HTML,
          CSS and JS.</p>
        <p>Both the module and final assignment, which was creating your personal website,
          weren't ones of my favourites. When I started to digging deeper and getting better
          at achieving my design goals I was getting more convinced to front-end web development
          and eventually decided to completely focus on this branch.
        </p>

        <p>I designed and built this website for three reasons. First of all, practice. I wanted
          instead of learning countless CSS rules put some of them into practice and see during
          the process what I still need to improve. Secondly, I wanted a place where I will be free
          to put all my work. Last but not least, I was curious if after many failures with my assignment website
          I eventually will be able to implement what I designed in the first place and finding solutions
          to constantly appearing problems. I can see now a big improvement in my CSS skills and I can't
          wait to make them even greater.</p>

            <h2>Web-based App for Finding a Mentor</h2>
            <p>A website application allowing university students to find a suitable mentor for them. </p>
            <p>This assignment helped me develop my leadership and team working skills as well as required to learn new
              for me
              technologies in a short period of time.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ruby</li>

            <h2>Wine Browser App</h2>
            <p>A GUI application that takes user's text input with different wines and their properties and applies
              sorting
              on the list based on chosen filters. It displays the sorted list in a user interface along with minimum,
              maximum
              and average properties as well as with histogram, which graphically shows proportion of wines based on
              selected property.
            </p>
            <p>This assignment helped me better understand OOP concept as well as Java Swing framework and put
              everything
              into practice.</p>

            <h2>Map Traversal Problem</h2>
            <p>A problem which required to accommodate a Branch and Bound algorithm to terrain map in order to return
              the
              shortest possible
              path between two points on mountain terrain with the least possible climbing. The second part of the
              project
              was to implement
              A* algorithm based on the code from previous part by including different heuristics in calculating the
              distance and then compare
              the efficiency of both algorithms.</p>
            <p>This assignment taught me theoretical knowledge by practice and how to use a LaTeX report.</p>

            <p>A website containing information about me as well as interactive quiz and charts.
            </p>
            <p>This assignment helped me put my basic at the time HTML, CSS and JS knowledge into practice. I have also
              learned using
              Google Chrome Developer Tools for development and Google lighthouse for testing. The project also brought
              my
              attention
              to importance of accessibility in webpages.

            <h2>Global Engineering Challenge Week Project</h2>
            <p>A week long team project. Our task was to find a solution to frequent power outages and low electrical
              coverage in Lobitos and Piedritas areas in
              northern cost of Peru. Our idea was to install small wind turbines connected power grid and car batteries.
              It would increase the coverage, generate enough energy for a housold
              and with enough amount of batteries also sell some of the energy to the national grid.</p>
            <p>This project streghen my leadership skills, required me to work in different engineering field than my
              own
              as well as
              improved my presentational and organisation skills.</p>
